### List of backward compatibility breaks ðŸ˜­ ðŸ˜­
* Importing the modules must be done with `:api<2>` attached to prevent loading modules from older packages if they are still installed.
* Instanciating a class or record is done using positional arguments instead of named arguments. The names of these methods will not be `new()` anymore but something like `new-*()`. E.g. `new-label($text)` or `new-grid()`.
* The `new()` call is only used for specific work. I.e.
  * Providing a native object from elsewhere with `:$native-object`.
  * Using an id with `:$build-id` to get a native object from an XML description.
* Inheriting mechanism is changed.
* Code is split into more separate files.
  * **Gnome::\<package>::\<class>**. Class names are as before.
  * **Gnome::\<package>::R-\<role>**. Name of roles are changed but is not a problem because they cannot be used as a class.
  * **Gnome::\<package>::N-\<structures>**. Structures and unions are stored separately. This is a change from the older packages. The structure names are also exported so that the last part can be used; E.g. **N-Error** imported with **Gnome::Glib::N-Error**. The object **N-Object** found in `Gnome::N` is widely used and was name N-GObject in the first project.
  * **Gnome::\<package>::T-\<types>**. A gathering of other types like constants and enumerations. The types are all exported.
* In the older packages GdkPixbuf was put into the Gdk3 package. The newer one will separate this. There is no pixbuf package for version 4. There it is solved differently.
* New packages are introduced in the new api; To name a few, `Gnome::Atk`, `Gnome::Pango`, `Gnome::Gsk4`, `Gnome::Gtk4`, and `Gnome::Gdk4`.
* No lists are returned to read veriables set by the native routines.
* Some cases where text was provided as an argument where it also needed to give the length of the string. In the older versions it was hidden. In the new version it must be provided.
* Possible and maybe for certain there will be no distributions for Gtk3 and Gdk3.

# Release notes
* 2023-12-22 0.13.2
  * Tried to find out how to inherit from Gtk classes. Needed to make a few small changes in the **Gnome::N::GnomeRoutineCaller** module and in the classes `_fallback-v2()` methods. I found it possible to just do that in a more simpler way than it was done in the api<1> version.
    Below a little example to show where user options can be provided;
    ```
    use Gnome::Gtk4::Label:api<2>;
    use Gnome::Gtk4::T-Enums:api<2>;

    class MyLabel is Gnome::Gtk4::Label {
      submethod BUILD ( *%options ) {
        with self {
          .set-use-markup(%options<do-markup>:exists);
          .set-hexpand(?%options<he>);              # :he True or False/Any
          .set-wrap(?%options<lw>);                 # :lw True or False/Any
          .set-justify(GTK_JUSTIFY_FILL);
          .set-halign(GTK_ALIGN_START);
          .set-valign(GTK_ALIGN_START);
          .set-margin-top((%options<mt> // 5).Int); # :mt defaultset to 5
          .set-margin-start(2);
        }
      }
    }

    my MyLabel $t1 .= new-label( 'test1', :lw, :he);
    note "hexpand: ", $t1.get-hexpand;              # hexpand: True
    note "line-wrap: ", $t1.get-wrap;               # line-wrap: True
    note "margin top: ", $t1.get-margin-top;        # margin top: 5

    my MyLabel $t2 .= new-with-mnemonic( '_test2', :10mt);
    note "hexpand: ", $t2.get-hexpand;              # hexpand: False
    note "line-wrap: ", $t2.get-wrap;               # line-wrap: False
    note "margin top: ", $t2.get-margin-top;        # margin top: 10
    ```
    Note that options are only useful in constructor methods, those with `new` in the name. For other methods and functions, the options are ignored.

    Must still mention that the information in such a class is not saved when the native object hiding in the class, is given to some native routine and later retrieved using another routine to rebuild the raku object with something like `$my-label .= new(:$native-object)`. Extra steps are needed to accomplish that.

    Now all existing classes must be changed ðŸ˜¦. I'll start with the Gtk4 classes. Newly generated classes will have this inherit possibility.

* 2023-12-20 0.13.1
  * GnomeRoutineCaller helpers will not return Lists anymore when there were any pointers (like CArray[]) where data is placed by called native routines. It was already needed to provide any pointers to the native routines.

* 2023-12-11 0.13.0
  * Split Doc into two modules hope to reduce compilation time
  * Split Code into two module to solve circular dependency

* 2023-12-09 0.12.4
  * Many bug fixes in doc generation
  * Add callback info to types document

* 2023-11-29 0.12.3
  * Skim results in repo-object.yaml files is changed to copy with misnaming the type result files and classes in some situations. E.g. `T-Aboutdialog` must be `T-AboutDialog`.
  * A records/union code is now stored together with its structure like in the older implementation. However, it is kept primitive. Also the name is prefixed with a 'N-' like its structure to show that it is different from a normal class.

* 2023-11-15 0.12.2
  * Found a bug in glib-2.0.gir file. Missing issue filed as `g_clear_error in glib gir file is missing a parameter #103`.

* 2023-11-13 0.12.1
  * Made a protected files yaml file. This is used to prevent overwriting the generated sources after modifications by hand. Most are changed documentation and test files because generating things can only go so far.

* 2023-10-30 0.12.0
  * Testing done of current implementation using a Hash with the native function information versus a method coded implementation. The latter is only marginally faster while having much more code for the methods would mean longer compile-times. This means that I will continue using a Hash to describe the native function and relying on the FALLBACK mechanism.

* 2023-10-22 0.11.6
  * Added more modules from Glib, GObject, Gio and Gtk4.
  * Native structures names are changed a small bit; N-GError becomes **N-Error** and N-GtkRequisition becomes **N-Requisition**. The only structure unchanged for now is **N-GObject**.
  * Added a META6.json generator using **META6**.
  * Changed **Gnome::Gio::File** from interface into class. Also the functions found in File to create the object are transformed into constructors. This is accomplished by changing the `C-File.gir` XML elements. To prevent overwriting, the skimming process does not overwrite the previously created gir files.
  * 'g_variant_new_variant' gave a clash 'g_variant_new' created by the generator because the latter is translated in `new-variant` while the first one got the same name. The latter is now translated into `new-variant-with-variant`. The trick is done by adding a key in the $methods Hash stating the real name.

* 2023-10-15 0.11.5
  * It is now possible to handle native functions having callback arguments

* 2023-09-27 0.11.4
  * Decided to add the Glib and Gio sections too.
  * Modules Application in Gio and Gtk4 added.
  * A test of an **Application** and **ApplicationWindow** with a **Button** works.
  * Made `N-GError` struct in GnomeRoutineCaller.
  * Another problem found to work on; `List` in Glib has subs which are also defined in Any. FALLBACK is then not called and Raku throws errors about wrong arg types.
  * **TopLevelClassSupport** is now inheriting from **Mu** which skips class **Any**. This prevents some clashes with routines found in **Any**.

* 2023-09-27 0.11.3
  * Reducing complexity by taking the glib and gio from :api<1>.
  * A few modules generated and tested from Gtk4
  * A first application of a **Window** with a **Button** without signals works.
  * First steps to get events working. `Clicked` on a **Button** did work but `Destroy` on a **Window** did not work. Seems to be a difference between the Gtk3 and Gtk4 version. A discussion on `discourse.gnome.org` did not bring a solution except the gnome team encouraging people to use **Application** and **ApplicationWindow**. In the mean time I found the proper signal name to use that works. It is called `close-request`.
  * Event signals work.

* 2023-09-20 0.11.2
  * Module **N-GValue**, **Value**, **T-Value** and **T-Type** added to `Gnome::GObject` and tested. **T-Type** is coded by hand and not generated because of missing constants in the gir system. An issue will be set at GitLab.
  * The attribute `$!g-type` is made read/write to make coding more simple. Previously one needed to do
    ```
    my N-GValue $native-object .= new;
    my Gnome::GObject::Value $value .= new(:$native-object);
    $value .= new(:native-object($value.init(G_TYPE_INT)));
    ```
    It was not possible to overwrite it with the `.init()` call to set another type, because it sees that a previous type was already set. Also `.reset()` only resets the value and not the type. Now that the **N-GValue** attribute is made read/write one can more easily change the type. Take care, however, that the value must be cleared in case of objects or other structures with the afore mentioned `.reset()`.

    ```
    # Init the Value first
    my N-GValue $native-object .= new;
    my Gnome::GObject::Value $value .= new(:$native-object);

    # Then use it
    $native-object.g-type = G_TYPE_ULONG;
    $value.set-ulong(â€¦ some unsigned integer â€¦);
    â€¦ use $value â€¦

    # Later â€¦
    $value.reset;
    $native-object.g-type = G_TYPE_STRING;
    $value.set-string(â€¦ some string â€¦);
    â€¦ use $value â€¦
    ```
  * Split program `gnome-source-skim-tool.raku` in two other programs namely; `skim-gir.raku` to skim the gir repo and `generate.raku` to create code, doc and test files.

* 2023-09-10 0.11.1
  * Start finding a new way to process native constructor functions. BUILD used options which do not map well to the arguments of those functions. Therefore after generating the module, some extra work needed to be done to get the named arguments right. To have less work afterwards, it is easier to have the user call the native routines directly. An example from the label class;
    Previously; `$label .= new(:mnemonic('â€¦'));`
    Now: `$label .= new-with-mnemonic('â€¦');`
    A special case must be made for the plain `new()` method. Found a way to handle that. Any plain `.new()` constructor is renamed into something like `.new-`_classname_`()`. This means that the new methods will break compatibility. Again an example from the label class;
    Previously; `$label .= new(:text('â€¦'));`
    Now `$label .= new-label('â€¦');`

* 2023-09-04 0.11.0
  * Modules, documents and test files are generated in new environment `./gnome-api2` in the package. They will be uploaded separately into the fez ecosystem. Later on, the META6 for each of the packages will be generated too.
  * Renamed module SkimGtkDoc into SkimGirSource

* 2023-06-09 0.20.0
  * Setup at version 0.1 for api<2>. Assuming that when noting is specified at the use statement, the highest version will prevail, that is, api<1>.
  * `Gnome::N` Modules copied from api<1> and added **GnomeRoutineCaller** and **GObjectSupport** to support api<2> `Gnome::*` releases.
  * Add a change in FALLBACK to cope with later modules from gnome-source-skim-tool. A check is made for existence of method `_fallback-v2()`.

* 2023-08-09 0.10.3
  * Many bugs fixed. Seems possible to generate working code without modifying much.
  * Started to generate Pango code.
  * First test files for classes generated.

* 2023-08-05 0.10.2
  * Moved the GnomeRoutineCaller module from `Gnome::Glib` to `Gnome::N`. This is a better location as a supporting module.
  * Another support module is made, called **Gnome::N::GObjectSupport**. This will hold methods like `.register-signal()` which were originally stored in **Gnome::GObject::Object**. It is automatically added to that module as a role. This is convenient now that everything is generated.

* 2023-07-26 0.10.1
  * Moved code from `SearchAndSubstitute()` back to Code module.
  * Add a program to make lists of gnome modules in old and in new packages. This is to be able to set the proper `:api<>` or inhibit `use` statements. For this to work `$*external-modules` needed to change as well as some methods.

* 2023-07-21 0.10.0
  * New modules and old one renamed.
  * Test enumerations, constants and bitfields completed.

* 2023-07-20 0.9.1
  * Options -f, -c, -r, -i, -u are removed to have the default effect of -f. Option -m is renamed to -c

* 2023-06-28 0.9.0
  * Add module **Gnome::SourceSkimTool::Union** to process union structures.
  * Tests with a few generated modules looks promising. The new modules used in the test are: Window, Bin, Comtainer, Widget and Buildable. The modules upon which it still depends are from the older Gtk libraries. Running the same test file `Window.rakutest` (only once) it shows the following;

    | Elapsed time | User time| Kernel time | Cpu % |  Note
    |---------|----------|-------------|--------------|------------------------
    | 0:02.33 |  1.73 | 0.16  |  81 | Old library
    | 0:34.73 | 43.19 | 2.03  | 130 | Old library with removed .precomp
    | 0:37.57 | 46.45 | 2.15  | 129 |
    | 0:33.00 | 41.69 | 1.97  | 132 |
    | 0:02.90 |  2.44 | 0.21  |  91 | New modules
    | 0:03.13 |  2.60 | 0.24  |  90 | New modules with removed .precomp
    | 0:03.37 |  3.18 | 0.25  | 101 |

    The tests show that normal runtimes are not differing much. But when everyhing needs to be recompiled, the newer modules compile much faster.
    I must make a note here. Removing the `.precompile` directories in the old Gtk library, involves more compiling for other modules needed as a side effect instead of only the Window, Bin, Container, Widget and Buildable modules. Its size after running is 16.2 Mb over 66 files and 29 sub folders(~ 245Kb/file). The newer .precomp files are 16.3 Kb over 5 files and 3 sub folders(~3kb/file). That's quite a difference. If I take this difference in files into account, about 66/5, and the increase in time, less than a sec., it would become 10 sec. at most.
    When the project evolves, these tests are repeated to see if this is really true.
  * Record and Union structures are generated in separate files. This means that there are more modules than in the original project. E,g. the original **Gnome::Gdk3::Events** have all event structures gathered in one file. The filenames will be something like `N-Record-name.rakumod` for each `N-Record-name` type. The same goes for unions. In a way this is the same for the `N-GObject` stored in `N-GObject.rakumod` in the **Gnome::N** package.

* 2023-06-19 0.8.3
  * Add module **Gnome::SourceSkimTool::File** to scan through data using a filename defined in field `class-file` in the `repo-object-map.yaml`. This may remove options -c, -i and -r.
  * Add bitfields. Generated as enumerations but are mostly used for masks. The type GFlag is used for those indicating an unsigned integer type.

* 2023-06-14 0.8.2
  * Renamed a few modules and classes.
  * Add records. Starting with Gdk events. All the records are in separate modules like EventButton, EventConfigure etc.

* 2023-06-12 0.8.1
  * Setup with Hash done on one class starting with **Gnome::Gtk3::Window**. The choice to use a hash is because there is no dependency on the gir libs or gir XML files. Focus is on generating code. The api-tag on a module is set to `:api<2>` to prevent looking for the wrong (older) modules. Next implemented modules are in the parent chain of Window, i.e. **Gnome::Gtk3::Bin**, **Gnome::Gtk3::Container** and **Gnome::Gtk3::Widget**. Further up is still on the old libraries. Looks promising.
  * Also roles can be implemented starting with **Gnome::Gtk3::Buildable**. Some trouble are fixed in using FALLBACK in roles. Fallback routine in **Gnome::N::TopLevelSupportClass** needed some changes to behave differently when in a newer class. Old software is tested and is ok.
  * Add enumerations.

* 2023-05-28 0.8.0
  After an interesting discussion on github issue #1 I created a test of a Window module. Suggestions were to use the GIR libraries or the XML files directly so there would not be any native subroutines declared in the module. This will save a lot of time when installing the module.
  This, however, adds a dependency which the user must install on their machines either the libraries or the XML files. Searching throught the XML files take a lot of time so this is not the right way.
  I've come up with an other solution which removes the dependency by generating a hash with all data to call a native function. Parsing should be quicker but the runtime slower because there are more calls to make before finally call the native routine.

* 2023-05-15 0.7.1
  * New module ListGirTypes to get a list of the introspect types and which names have a specified type.
  * Things get too unwieldy. Looking at the huge inventory of records in GLib I decided to split the generation of modules into several parts; classes, records and interfaces. Also documentation of all parts as in, description,  API parameters of methods, functions, callbacks and handlers.
  * ClassModule works again.
  * InterfaceModule works.

* 2023-05-12 0.7.0
  * Look into the lowest level of libs: Glib.
  * Generate modules from records. Records in the gir files are the structures defined in C.

* 2023-05-10 0.6.2
  * Generate functions

* 2023-05-03 0.6.1
  * Add commented fallback routines which are to be deprecated with proper version messages. They are commented out because newer modules must not use it and older routines must be deprecated.

* 2023-04-26 0.6.0
  * Move methods from GenRakuModule to a new module SearchAndSubstitute
  * Generating roles
  * Importing roles

* 2023-04-20 0.5.6
  * Generate different types of methods depending on arguments and return types.
    * Coercion to native types for objects and other Raku types.
    * Return List for pointer variables who get values returned that way.
    * Convert Str Array's to and from native CArray's.

* 2023-04-17 0.5.5
  * Generate methods.

* 2023-04-07 0.5.4
  * Generate BUILD submethod.
  * Add constructor native subs.

* 2023-04-01 0.5.3
  * Generate property information.

* 2023-04-01 0.5.2
  * Generate signal information.

* 2023-03-29 0.5.1
  * Generate class description
  * Generate `use` and `unit` lines
  * Convert signal and property info.
  * Convert Markdown links.
  * Convert code sections.

* 2023-03-11 0.5.0
  * Looking into other repositories such as Glib I've seen that there are problems reading the xml code generated by gtkdoc. For instance, the file error-reporting.xml has symbols used in the docs to emphasize words like `<MODULE>`. That is not properly escaped with `&lt;` and `&gt;`. So those words are seen as an XML element which causes errors. It is imparative that the Raku modules can handle all data in the same way and therefore the gtkdoc is not the proper way to go further. Luckily, there is still another way and that is using the GObject Introspection Repository which consists of a library of routines to get the classes and methods information as well as the signals and properties. The documentation for all this info can be found in so called `.gir` files which are XML files. This also means that, when it works, all locally downloaded source code in the `Gnome` directory can be removed.

* 2023-02-04 0.4.3
  * Need to change the selection based on `$*sub-prefix` because of the 3 packagages Glib, Gio and GObject. The functions prefix all start with `g_` and therefore it cannot decide to which package the prefix belongs.
  * GtkDoc is now working on glib, gobject, gio and gdk version 3 too. Still stuck on gtk version 4.

* 2023-03-02 0.4.2
  * **ApiDoc** Add Hierarchy to objects.yaml.

* 2023-02-27 0.4.1
  * **ModuleDoc** Get enums names, store in module yaml file.
  * **ModuleDoc** Get enum values, store in objects.yaml.

* 2023-02-25 0.4.0
  * **Gnome::SourceSkimTool::SkimGtkDoc::ApiDoc** Get overview of all objects, types and more from `api-index-full.xml`.
  * **ApiDoc** Get deprecated data from `api-index-deprecated.xml`.
  * Store in objects.yaml.

* 2023-02-20 0.3.2
  * **ModuleDoc** Get signals info.
  * **ModuleDoc** Get properties info.
  * Store in module yaml file.

* 2023-02-18 0.3.1
  * **ModuleDoc**; Add function return value and parameters.
  * **ModuleDoc**; Add return value doc.

* 2023-02-17 0.3.0
  * **ModuleDoc**; Add scan of functions from generated module files e.g. `gtkbutton.xml`

* 2023-02-16 0.2.0
  * **Gnome::SourceSkimTool::SkimGtkDoc::ModuleDoc** Add scan of descriptions

* 2023-02-10 0.1.1
  * Got GtkDoc to work, especially the generated program `*-scan.c`.

* 2023-02-06 0.1.0
  * The thought was to rewrite the original code from `gnome-gtk3-source-skim-tool.raku` and its derivatives which I used to generate the Raku code. Now I've found out about GtkDoc. This program scans through the Gnome sources and generates several text and xml files. The result of the scan is available in sections describing code, calls, macros, docs, and more. So that will become the vehicle to generate the Raku code and documentation (if I get it to work).

* 2023-01-01 0.0.1
  * Setup **Gnome::SourceSkimTool**
