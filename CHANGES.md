  * The thought was to rewrite the original code from gnome-gtk3-source-skim-tol.raku and its derivatives. Now I've found out about GtkDoc. This program scans through the Gnome sources and generate several text and xml files. The result of the scan is available in sections describing code, calls, macros, docs, and more. So that will become the vehicle to generate the Raku code and documentation.
