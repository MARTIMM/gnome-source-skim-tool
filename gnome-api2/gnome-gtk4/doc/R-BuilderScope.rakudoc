=TITLE Gnome::Gtk4::R-BuilderScope
=head1 Description

L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-BuilderScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-BuilderScope> is an interface to provide language binding support
to L<Gnome::Gtk4::Builder|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/Builder>.

The goal of L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-BuilderScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-BuilderScope> is to look up programming-language-specific
values for strings that are given in a L<Gnome::Gtk4::Builder|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/Builder> UI file.

The primary intended audience is bindings that want to provide deeper
integration of L<Gnome::Gtk4::Builder|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/Builder> into the language.

A L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-BuilderScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-BuilderScope> instance may be used with multiple L<Gnome::Gtk4::Builder|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/Builder> objects,
even at once.

By default, GTK will use its own implementation of L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-BuilderScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-BuilderScope>
for the C language which can be created via L<.newbuilderscope() in class BuilderCScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/BuilderCScope#newbuilderscope>.

If you implement L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-BuilderScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-BuilderScope> for a language binding, you
may want to (partially) derive from or fall back to a L<Gnome::Gtk4::BuilderCScope|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/BuilderCScope>,
as that class implements support for automatic lookups from C symbols.
