=TITLE Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync
=head1 Description

B<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync> is an event controller to receive Drag-and-Drop
operations, asynchronously.

It is the more complete but also more complex method of handling drop
operations compared to L<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTarget|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/DropTarget>, and you should only use
it if L<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTarget|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/DropTarget> doesn't provide all the features you need.

To use a B<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync> to receive drops on a widget, you create
a B<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync> object, configure which data formats and actions
you support, connect to its signals, and then attach it to the widget
with L<.add-controller() in class Widget|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/Widget#add-controller>.

During a drag operation, the first signal that a B<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync>
emits is I<accept>, which is meant to determine
whether the target is a possible drop site for the ongoing drop. The
default handler for the I<accept> signal accepts the drop if it finds
a compatible data format and an action that is supported on both sides.

If it is, and the widget becomes a target, you will receive a
I<drag-enter> signal, followed by
I<drag-motion> signals as the pointer moves,
optionally a I<drop> signal when a drop happens,
and finally a I<drag-leave> signal when the
pointer moves off the widget.

The I<drag-enter> and I<drag-motion> handler return a C<bit field GdkDragAction defined in Gnome::Gdk4::T-enums>
to update the status of the ongoing operation. The I<drop> handler
should decide if it ultimately accepts the drop and if it does, it
should initiate the data transfer and finish the operation by calling
L<.finish() in class Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop#finish>.

Between the I<drag-enter> and I<drag-leave> signals the widget is a
current drop target, and will receive the C<GTK_STATE_FLAG_DROP_ACTIVE>
state, which can be used by themes to style the widget as a drop target.

=head3 accept

Emitted on the drop site when a drop operation is about to begin.

If the drop is not accepted, C<False> will be returned and the drop target
will ignore the drop. If C<True> is returned, the drop is accepted for now
but may be rejected later via a call to L<.reject-drop()|#reject-drop>
or ultimately by returning C<False> from a I<drop>
handler.

The default handler for this signal decides whether to accept the drop
based on the formats provided by the C<$drop>.

If the decision whether the drop will be accepted or rejected needs
further processing, such as inspecting the data, this function should
return C<True> and proceed as is C<$drop> was accepted and if it decides to
reject the drop later, it should call L<.reject-drop()|#reject-drop>.

   $drop,

=head3 drop

Emitted on the drop site when the user drops the data onto the widget.

The signal handler must determine whether the pointer position is in a
drop zone or not. If it is not in a drop zone, it returns C<False> and no
further processing is necessary.

Otherwise, the handler returns C<True>. In this case, this handler will
accept the drop. The handler must ensure that L<.finish() in class Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop#finish>
is called to let the source know that the drop is done. The call to
L<.finish() in class Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop#finish> must only be done when all data has been received.

To receive the data, use one of the read functions provided by
L<Gnome::Gdk4::Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop> such as L<.read-async() in class Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop#read-async> or
L<.read-value-async() in class Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop#read-value-async>.

=begin code
method handler (
   $drop,
  gdouble $x,
  gdouble $y,
  Int :$_handle_id,
  N-GObject :$_native-object,
  Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync :$_widget,
  *%user-options
  --> gboolean
)
=end code

=item $drop; the L<Gnome::Gdk4::Drop|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gdk4/Drop>.
=item $x; the x coordinate of the current pointer position.
=item $y; the y coordinate of the current pointer position.
=item $_handle_id; The registered event handler id.
=item $_native-object; The native object provided by the Raku object which registered this event. This is a native B<Gnome::Gtk4::DropTargetAsync> object.
=item %user-options; A list of named arguments provided by L<.register-signal() in class Object|/content-docs/api2/reference/GObject/Object#register-signal>.

Return value; whether the drop is accepted at the given pointer position
