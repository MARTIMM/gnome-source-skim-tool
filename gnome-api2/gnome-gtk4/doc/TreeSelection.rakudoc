=head1 Description

The selection object for GtkTreeView

The B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection> object is a helper object to manage the selection
for a B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeView> widget.  The B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection> object is
automatically created when a new B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeView> widget is created, and
cannot exist independently of this widget.  The primary reason the
B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection> objects exists is for cleanliness of code and API.
That is, there is no conceptual reason all these functions could not be
methods on the B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeView> widget instead of a separate function.

The B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection> object is gotten from a B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeView> by calling
gtk_tree_view_get_selection().  It can be manipulated to check the
selection status of the tree, as well as select and deselect individual
rows.  Selection is done completely view side.  As a result, multiple
views of the same model can have completely different selections.
Additionally, you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that
is not currently displayed by the view without expanding its parents
first.

One of the important things to remember when monitoring the selection of
a view is that the B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection>::changed signal is mostly a hint.
That is, it may only emit one signal when a range of rows is selected.
Additionally, it may on occasion emit a B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection>::changed signal
when nothing has happened (mostly as a result of programmers calling
select_row on an already selected row).

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Sets C<$iter> to the currently selected node if C<$selection> is set to
C<GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE> or C<GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE>.  C<$iter> may be NULL if you
just want to test if C<$selection> has any selected nodes.  C<$model> is filled
with the current model as a convenience.  This function will not work if you
use C<$selection> is C<GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE>.

=begin pod
=head2 get-selected-rows

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Creates a list of path of all selected rows. Additionally, if you are
planning on modifying the model after calling this function, you may
want to convert the returned list into a list of B<Gnome::Gtk4::N-TreeRowReference>s.
To do this, you can use gtk_tree_row_reference_new().

To free the return value, use:

=head3 changed

Emitted whenever the selection has (possibly) changed. Please note that
this signal is mostly a hint.  It may only be emitted once when a range
of rows are selected, and it may occasionally be emitted when nothing
has happened.

=begin code
method handler (
  Int :$_handle_id,
  N-GObject :$_native-object,
  Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection :$_widget,
  *C<user>-options
)
=end code

=item $_handle_id; The registered event handler id.
=item $_native-object; The native object provided by the Raku object which registered this event. This a native B<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeSelection> object.
=item $_widget; The object which registered the signal. User code may have left the object going out of scope.
=item C<user>-options; A list of named arguments provided at the C<.register-signal()> method from B<Gnome::GObject::Object>.
