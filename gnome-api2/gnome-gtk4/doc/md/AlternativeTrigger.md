Description
===========

A *GtkShortcutTrigger* that combines two triggers.

The **Gnome::Gtk4::AlternativeTrigger** triggers when either of two trigger.

This can be cascaded to combine more than two triggers.

Class initialization
====================

new
---

### :native-object

Create an object using a native object from elsewhere. See also **Gnome::N::TopLevelSupportClass**.

    multi method new ( N-Object :$native-object! )

new-alternativetrigger
----------------------

Creates a *GtkShortcutTrigger* that will trigger whenever either of the two given triggers gets triggered.

Note that nesting is allowed, so if you want more than two alternative, create a new alternative trigger for each option.

    method new-alternativetrigger ( N-Object() $first, N-Object() $second --> Gnome::Gtk4::AlternativeTrigger )

  * $first; (transfer ownership: full) The first trigger that may trigger.

  * $second; (transfer ownership: full) The second trigger that may trigger.
