=head1 Description

An interface for packing cells

L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout> is an interface to be implemented by all objects which
want to provide a L<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeViewColumn|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/TreeViewColumn> like API for packing cells,
setting attributes and data funcs.

One of the notable features provided by implementations of
L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout> are attributes. Attributes let you set the properties
in flexible ways. They can just be set to constant values like regular
properties. But they can also be mapped to a column of the underlying
tree model with C<.set-attributes()>, which means that the value
of the attribute can change from cell to cell as they are rendered by
the cell renderer. Finally, it is possible to specify a function with
C<.set-cell-data-func()> that is called to determine the
value of the attribute for each cell that is rendered.

=head3 GtkCellLayouts as GtkBuildable

Implementations of GtkCellLayout which also implement the GtkBuildable
interface (L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellView|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellView>, L<Gnome::Gtk4::IconView|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/IconView>, L<Gnome::Gtk4::ComboBox|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/ComboBox>,
L<Gnome::Gtk4::EntryCompletion|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/EntryCompletion>, L<Gnome::Gtk4::TreeViewColumn|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/TreeViewColumn>) accept L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer> objects
as `<child>` elements in UI definitions. They support a custom `<attributes>`
element for their children, which can contain multiple `<attribute>`
elements. Each `<attribute>` element has a name attribute which specifies
a property of the cell renderer; the content of the element is the
attribute value.

This is an example of a UI definition fragment specifying attributes:

=begin comment
<object class="GtkCellView">
  <child>
    <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
    <attributes>
      <attribute name="text">0</attribute>
    </attributes>
  </child>
</object>

=end comment

Furthermore for implementations of L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout> that use a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellArea|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellArea>
to lay out cells (all L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout>s in GTK use a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellArea|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellArea>)
[cell properties](class.CellArea.html#cell-properties) can also be defined
in the format by specifying the custom `<cell-packing>` attribute which can
contain multiple `<property>` elements.

Here is a UI definition fragment specifying cell properties:

=begin comment
<object class="GtkTreeViewColumn">
  <child>
    <object class="GtkCellRendererText"/>
    <cell-packing>
      <property name="align">True</property>
      <property name="expand">False</property>
    </cell-packing>
  </child>
</object>

=head3 Subclassing GtkCellLayout implementations

When subclassing a widget that implements L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout> like
L<Gnome::Gtk4::IconView|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/IconView> or L<Gnome::Gtk4::ComboBox|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/ComboBox>, there are some considerations related
to the fact that these widgets internally use a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellArea|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellArea>.
The cell area is exposed as a construct-only property by these
widgets. This means that it is possible to e.g. do

=begin comment
GtkWIdget *combo =
  g_object_new (GTK_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", my_cell_area, NULL);

=end comment

to use a custom cell area with a combo box. But construct properties
are only initialized after instance B<init>()`
functions have run, which means that using functions which rely on
the existence of the cell area in your subclass B<init>()` function will
cause the default cell area to be instantiated. In this case, a provided
construct property value will be ignored (with a warning, to alert
you to the problem).

=begin comment
static void
my_combo_box_init (MyComboBox *b)
{
  GtkCellRenderer *cell;

  cell = gtk_cell_renderer_pixbuf_new ();

  // The following call causes the default cell area for combo boxes,
  // a GtkCellAreaBox, to be instantiated
  gtk_cell_layout_pack_start (GTK_CELL_LAYOUT (b), cell, FALSE);
  ...
}

GtkWidget *
my_combo_box_new (GtkCellArea *area)
{
  // This call is going to cause a warning about area being ignored
  return g_object_new (MY_TYPE_COMBO_BOX, "cell-area", area, NULL);
}

=end comment

If supporting alternative cell areas with your derived widget is
not important, then this does not have to concern you. If you want
to support alternative cell areas, you can do so by moving the
problematic calls out of B<init>()` and into a B<constructor>()`
for your class.

=begin pod
=head2 add-attribute

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Adds an attribute mapping to the list in C<$cell-layout>.

The C<$column> is the column of the model to get a value from, and the C<$attribute> is the property on C<$cell> to be set from that value. So for
example if column 2 of the model contains strings, you could have the
“text” attribute of a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRendererText|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRendererText> get its values from column 2.
In this context "attribute" and "property" are used interchangeably.

=begin code
method add-attribute ( N-Object() $cell, Str $attribute, Int() $column )
=end code

=item $cell; a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer>.
=item $attribute; a property on the renderer.
=item $column; the column position on the model to get the attribute from.

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Returns the underlying L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellArea|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellArea> which might be C<$cell-layout>
if called on a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellArea|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellArea> or might be undefined if no L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellArea|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellArea>
is used by C<$cell-layout>.

=begin code

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Returns the cell renderers which have been added to C<$cell-layout>.

=begin code
method get-cells (--> N-List )
=end code

Return value; 
  a list of cell renderers. The list, but not the renderers has
  been newly allocated and should be freed with g_list_free()
  when no longer needed..

=begin pod
=head2 pack-end

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Adds the C<$cell> to the end of C<$cell-layout>. If C<$expand> is C<False>, then the C<$cell> is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space is
divided evenly between cells for which C<$expand> is C<True>.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.

=begin code
method pack-end ( N-Object() $cell, Bool() $expand )
=end code

=item $cell; a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer>.
=item $expand; C<True> if C<$cell> is to be given extra space allocated to C<$cell-layout>.

=begin pod
=head2 pack-start

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Packs the C<$cell> into the beginning of C<$cell-layout>. If C<$expand> is C<False>,
then the C<$cell> is allocated no more space than it needs. Any unused space
is divided evenly between cells for which C<$expand> is C<True>.

Note that reusing the same cell renderer is not supported.

=begin code
method pack-start ( N-Object() $cell, Bool() $expand )
=end code

=item $cell; a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer>.
=item $expand; C<True> if C<$cell> is to be given extra space allocated to C<$cell-layout>.

=head2 reorder

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Re-inserts C<$cell> at C<$position>.

Note that C<$cell> has already to be packed into C<$cell-layout>
for this to function properly.

=begin code
method reorder ( N-Object() $cell, Int() $position )
=end code

=item $cell; a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer> to reorder.
=item $position; new position to insert C<$cell> at.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=begin pod
=head2 set-attributes

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Sets the attributes in the parameter list as the attributes
of C<$cell-layout>.

See L<.add-attribute()|#add-attribute> for more details.

The attributes should be in attribute/column order, as in
C<.add-attribute()>. All existing attributes are
removed, and replaced with the new attributes.

=begin code
method set-attributes ( N-Object() $cell, … )
=end code

=item $cell; a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer>.
=item …; …. Note that each argument must be specified as a type followed by its value!

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=begin pod
=head2 set-cell-data-func

B<Note: The native version of this routine is deprecated in gtk4-lib() since version 4.10>

Sets the L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout>DataFunc to use for C<$cell-layout>.

This function is used instead of the standard attributes mapping
for setting the column value, and should set the value of C<$cell-layout>’s
cell renderer(s) as appropriate.
 C<$func> may be undefined to remove a previously set function.

=begin code
method set-cell-data-func ( N-Object() $cell, GtkCellLayoutDataFunc &func, gpointer $func-data, GDestroyNotify &destroy )
=end code

=item $cell; a L<Gnome::Gtk4::CellRenderer|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/CellRenderer>.
=item GtkCellLayoutDataFunc &func; the L<Gnome::Gtk4::R-CellLayout|/content-docs/api2/reference/Gtk4/R-CellLayout>DataFunc to use. The function must be specified with the following signature; C<:( N-Object $cell-layout, N-Object $cell, N-Object $tree-model, N-Object $iter, gpointer $data )>.
=item $func-data; user data for C<$func>.
=item GDestroyNotify &destroy; destroy notify for C<$func-data>. The function must be specified with the following signature; C<:( gpointer $data )>.
