=head2 G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT

Use this for default priority event sources.

In GLib this priority is used when adding timeout functions
with g_timeout_add(). In GDK this priority is used for events
from the X server.

=head2 G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT_IDLE

Use this for default priority idle functions.

In GLib this priority is used when adding idle functions with
g_idle_add().

=head2 G_PRIORITY_HIGH

Use this for high priority event sources.

It is not used within GLib or GTK.

=head2 G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE

Use this for high priority idle functions.

GTK uses C<G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE> + 10 for resizing operations,
and C<G_PRIORITY_HIGH_IDLE> + 20 for redrawing operations. (This is
done to ensure that any pending resizes are processed before any
pending redraws, so that widgets are not redrawn twice unnecessarily.)

=head2 G_PRIORITY_LOW

Use this for very low priority background tasks.

It is not used within GLib or GTK.

=head2 G_SOURCE_CONTINUE

Use this macro as the return value of a B<Gnome::Glib::T-main> to leave
the B<Gnome::Glib::N-Source> in the main loop.

=head2 child-watch-add
This function is not yet available

Sets a function to be called when the child indicated by C<$pid>
exits, at a default priority, C<G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT>.

If you obtain C<$pid> from g_spawn_async() or g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
you will need to pass C<G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD> as flag to
the spawn function for the child watching to work.

Note that on platforms where B<Gnome::Glib::Main> must be explicitly closed
(see g_spawn_close_pid()) C<$pid> must not be closed while the
source is still active. Typically, you will want to call
g_spawn_close_pid() in the callback function for the source.

GLib supports only a single callback per process id.
On POSIX platforms, the same restrictions mentioned for
g_child_watch_source_new() apply to this function.

This internally creates a main loop source using
g_child_watch_source_new() and attaches it to the main loop context
using g_source_attach(). You can do these steps manually if you
need greater control.

=begin code

This function is not yet available

Sets a function to be called when the child indicated by C<$pid>
exits, at the priority C<$priority>.

If you obtain C<$pid> from g_spawn_async() or g_spawn_async_with_pipes()
you will need to pass C<G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD> as flag to
the spawn function for the child watching to work.

In many programs, you will want to call g_spawn_check_wait_status()
in the callback to determine whether or not the child exited
successfully.

Also, note that on platforms where B<Gnome::Glib::Main> must be explicitly closed
(see g_spawn_close_pid()) C<$pid> must not be closed while the source
is still active.  Typically, you should invoke g_spawn_close_pid()
in the callback function for the source.

=begin pod
=head2 child-watch-source-new
This function is not yet available

Creates a new child_watch source.

The source will not initially be associated with any B<Gnome::Glib::N-MainContext>
and must be added to one with g_source_attach() before it will be
executed.

Note that child watch sources can only be used in conjunction with
B<g_spawn...> when the C<G_SPAWN_DO_NOT_REAP_CHILD> flag is used.

Note that on platforms where B<Gnome::Glib::Main> must be explicitly closed
(see g_spawn_close_pid()) C<$pid> must not be closed while the
source is still active. Typically, you will want to call
g_spawn_close_pid() in the callback function for the source.

On POSIX platforms, the following restrictions apply to this API
due to limitations in POSIX process interfaces:

* C<$pid> must be a child of this process
* C<$pid> must be positive
* the application must not call B<waitpid> with a non-positive
  first argument, for instance in another thread
* the application must not wait for C<$pid> to exit by any other
  mechanism, including B<waitpid(pid, ...)> or a second child-watch
  source for the same C<$pid>
* the application must not ignore B<SIGCHLD>
* Before 2.78, the application could not send a signal (B<kill()>) to the
  watched C<$pid> in a race free manner. Since 2.78, you can do that while the
  associated B<Gnome::Glib::N-MainContext> is acquired.
* Before 2.78, even after destroying the B<Gnome::Glib::N-Source>, you could not
  be sure that C<$pid> wasn't already reaped. Hence, it was also not
  safe to B<kill()> or B<waitpid()> on the process ID after the child watch
  source was gone. Destroying the source before it fired made it
  impossible to reliably reap the process.

If any of those conditions are not met, this and related APIs will
not work correctly. This can often be diagnosed via a GLib warning
stating that B<ECHILD> was received by B<waitpid>.

Calling B<waitpid> for specific processes other than C<$pid> remains a
valid thing to do.

Queries the system monotonic time.

The monotonic clock will always increase and doesn't suffer
discontinuities when the user (or NTP) changes the system time.  It
may or may not continue to tick during times where the machine is
suspended.

We try to use the clock that corresponds as closely as possible to
the passage of time as measured by system calls such as poll() but it
may not always be possible to do this.

Queries the system wall-clock time.

This call is functionally equivalent to g_get_current_time() except
that the return value is often more convenient than dealing with a
B<Gnome::Glib::N-TimeVal>.

You should only use this call if you are actually interested in the real
wall-clock time.  g_get_monotonic_time() is probably more useful for
measuring intervals.

=head2 idle-add

Adds a function to be called whenever there are no higher priority
events pending to the default main loop. The function is given the

returns C<False> it is automatically removed from the list of event
sources and will not be called again.

See memory management of sources for details
on how to handle the return value and memory management of C<$data>.

This internally creates a main loop source using g_idle_source_new()
and attaches it to the global B<Gnome::Glib::N-MainContext> using g_source_attach(), so
the callback will be invoked in whichever thread is running that main

Gets the thread-default B<Gnome::Glib::N-MainContext> for this thread. Asynchronous

programs applications may sometimes want to temporarily push a
non-default context, so it is not safe to assume that this will

Returns the depth of the stack of calls to

That is, when called from the toplevel, it gives 0. When
called from within a callback from C<.context-iteration()>
(or C<.loop-run()>, etc.) it returns 1. When called from within
a callback to a recursive call to C<.context-iteration()>,
it returns 2. And so forth.

This function is useful in a situation like the following:
Imagine an extremely simple "garbage collected" system.

This works from an application, however, if you want to do the same
thing from a library, it gets more difficult, since you no longer
control the main loop. You might think you can simply use an idle
function to make the call to free_allocated_memory(), but that
doesn't work, since the idle function could be called from a
recursive callback. This can be fixed by using C<.depth()>

=begin comment
<!-- language="C" -->
gpointer
allocate_memory (gsize size)
{
  FreeListBlock *block = g_new (FreeListBlock, 1);
  block->mem = g_malloc (size);

  free_list = g_list_prepend (free_list, block);
  return block->mem;
}

free_allocated_memory (void)

There is a temptation to use C<.depth()> to solve
problems with reentrancy. For instance, while waiting for data
to be received from the network in response to a menu item,
the menu item might be selected again. It might seem that
one could make the menu item's callback return immediately
and do nothing if C<.depth()> returns a value greater than 1.
However, this should be avoided since the user then sees selecting
the menu item do nothing. Furthermore, you'll find yourself adding
these checks all over your code, since there are doubtless many,
many things that the user could do. Instead, you can use the
following techniques:

1. Use gtk_widget_set_sensitive() or modal dialogs to prevent
   the user from interacting with elements while the main
   loop is recursing.

2. Avoid main loop recursion in situations where you can't handle
   arbitrary  callbacks. Instead, structure your code so that you
   simply return to the main loop and then get called again when
   there is more work to do.

=head2 source-remove

Removes the source with the given ID from the default main context. You must
use g_source_destroy() for sources added to a non-default main context.

The ID of a B<Gnome::Glib::N-Source> is given by g_source_get_id(), or will be
returned by the functions g_source_attach(), g_idle_add(),
g_idle_add_full(), g_timeout_add(), g_timeout_add_full(),
g_child_watch_add(), g_child_watch_add_full(), g_io_add_watch(), and
g_io_add_watch_full().

It is a programmer error to attempt to remove a non-existent source.

More specifically: source IDs can be reissued after a source has been
destroyed and therefore it is never valid to use this function with a
source ID which may have already been removed.  An example is when
scheduling an idle to run in another thread with g_idle_add(): the
idle may already have run and been removed by the time this function
is called on its (now invalid) source ID.  This source ID may have
been reissued, leading to the operation being performed against the
wrong source.

Sets the name of a source using its ID.

This is a convenience utility to set source names from the return
value of g_idle_add(), g_timeout_add(), etc.

It is a programmer error to attempt to set the name of a non-existent
source.

More specifically: source IDs can be reissued after a source has been
destroyed and therefore it is never valid to use this function with a
source ID which may have already been removed.  An example is when
scheduling an idle to run in another thread with g_idle_add(): the
idle may already have run and been removed by the time this function
is called on its (now invalid) source ID.  This source ID may have
been reissued, leading to the operation being performed against the

=begin pod
=head2 timeout-add

Sets a function to be called at regular intervals, with the default
priority, C<G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT>.

The given C<$function> is called repeatedly until it returns C<G_SOURCE_REMOVE>
or C<False>, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and the
function will not be called again. The first call to the function will be
at the end of the first C<$interval>.

Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other
event sources. Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing.
After each call to the timeout function, the time of the next
timeout is recalculated based on the current time and the given interval
(it does not try to 'catch up' time lost in delays).

See memory management of sources for details
on how to handle the return value and memory management of C<$data>.

If you want to have a timer in the "seconds" range and do not care
about the exact time of the first call of the timer, use the
g_timeout_add_seconds() function; this function allows for more
optimizations and more efficient system power usage.

This internally creates a main loop source using g_timeout_source_new()
and attaches it to the global B<Gnome::Glib::N-MainContext> using g_source_attach(), so
the callback will be invoked in whichever thread is running that main
context. You can do these steps manually if you need greater control or to
use a custom main context.

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

The interval given is in terms of monotonic time, not wall clock
time.  See g_get_monotonic_time().

=begin code
method timeout-add ( UInt() $interval, &function, gpointer $data --> UInt )
=end code

=item $interval; the time between calls to the function, in milliseconds
   (1/1000ths of a second).
=item &function; function to call. Tthe function must be specified with following signature; C<:( gpointer $user-data --> gboolean )>.
=item $data; data to pass to C<$function>.

Return value; the ID (greater than 0) of the event source..

Sets a function to be called at regular intervals with the default
priority, C<G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT>.

The function is called repeatedly until it returns C<G_SOURCE_REMOVE>
or C<False>, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed
and the function will not be called again.

This internally creates a main loop source using
g_timeout_source_new_seconds() and attaches it to the main loop context
using g_source_attach(). You can do these steps manually if you need
greater control. Also see g_timeout_add_seconds_full().

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

Note that the first call of the timer may not be precise for timeouts
of one second. If you need finer precision and have such a timeout,
you may want to use g_timeout_add() instead.

=begin pod
=head2 timeout-add-seconds-full

Sets a function to be called at regular intervals, with C<$priority>.

The function is called repeatedly until it returns C<G_SOURCE_REMOVE>
or C<False>, at which point the timeout is automatically destroyed and
the function will not be called again.

Unlike g_timeout_add(), this function operates at whole second granularity.
The initial starting point of the timer is determined by the implementation
and the implementation is expected to group multiple timers together so that
they fire all at the same time. To allow this grouping, the C<$interval> to the
first timer is rounded and can deviate up to one second from the specified
interval. Subsequent timer iterations will generally run at the specified
interval.

Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other
event sources. Thus they should not be relied on for precise timing.
After each call to the timeout function, the time of the next
timeout is recalculated based on the current time and the given C<$interval>

See memory management of sources for details
on how to handle the return value and memory management of C<$data>.

If you want timing more precise than whole seconds, use g_timeout_add()
instead.

The grouping of timers to fire at the same time results in a more power
and CPU efficient behavior so if your timer is in multiples of seconds
and you don't require the first timer exactly one second from now, the
use of g_timeout_add_seconds() is preferred over g_timeout_add().

This internally creates a main loop source using
g_timeout_source_new_seconds() and attaches it to the main loop context
using g_source_attach(). You can do these steps manually if you need
greater control.

It is safe to call this function from any thread.

time.  See g_get_monotonic_time().
