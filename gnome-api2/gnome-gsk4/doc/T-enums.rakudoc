=head2 GskBlendMode

The blend modes available for render nodes.

The implementation of each blend mode is deferred to the
rendering pipeline.

See <https://www.w3.org/TR/compositing-1/#blending> for more information
on blending and blend modes.
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_DEFAULT>; The default blend mode, which specifies no blending
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_MULTIPLY>; The source color is multiplied by the destination
  and replaces the destination
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_SCREEN>; Multiplies the complements of the destination and source
  color values, then complements the result.
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_OVERLAY>; Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the
  destination color value. This is the inverse of hard-list
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_DARKEN>; Selects the darker of the destination and source colors
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_LIGHTEN>; Selects the lighter of the destination and source colors

=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_EXCLUSION>; Produces an effect similar to that of the difference mode but lower in contrast

=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_HUE>; Creates a color with the hue of the source color and the saturation and luminosity of the destination color
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_SATURATION>; Creates a color with the saturation of the source color and the hue and luminosity of the destination color
=item C<GSK_BLEND_MODE_LUMINOSITY>; Creates a color with the luminosity of the source color and the hue and saturation of the destination color

=head2 GskCorner

The corner indices used by B<Gnome::Gsk4::N-RoundedRect>.
=item C<GSK_CORNER_TOP_LEFT>; The top left corner
=item C<GSK_CORNER_TOP_RIGHT>; The top right corner
=item C<GSK_CORNER_BOTTOM_RIGHT>; The bottom right corner
=item C<GSK_CORNER_BOTTOM_LEFT>; The bottom left corner

=head2 GskGLUniformType

This defines the types of the uniforms that B<GskGLShaders>
declare.

It defines both what the type is called in the GLSL shader
code, and what the corresponding C type is on the Gtk side.
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_NONE>; No type, used for uninitialized or unspecified values.
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_FLOAT>; A float uniform
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_INT>; A GLSL int / gint32 uniform
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_UINT>; A GLSL uint / guint32 uniform
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_BOOL>; A GLSL bool / gboolean uniform
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_VEC2>; A GLSL vec2 / graphene_vec2_t uniform
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_VEC3>; A GLSL vec3 / graphene_vec3_t uniform
=item C<GSK_GL_UNIFORM_TYPE_VEC4>; A GLSL vec4 / graphene_vec4_t uniform

=head2 GskRenderNodeType

The type of a node determines what the node is rendering.
=item C<GSK_NOT_A_RENDER_NODE>; Error type. No node will ever have this type.
=item C<GSK_CONTAINER_NODE>; A node containing a stack of children
=item C<GSK_CAIRO_NODE>; A node drawing a B<Gnome::Cairo::N-Context>
=item C<GSK_COLOR_NODE>; A node drawing a single color rectangle
=item C<GSK_LINEAR_GRADIENT_NODE>; A node drawing a linear gradient
=item C<GSK_REPEATING_LINEAR_GRADIENT_NODE>; A node drawing a repeating linear gradient
=item C<GSK_RADIAL_GRADIENT_NODE>; A node drawing a radial gradient
=item C<GSK_REPEATING_RADIAL_GRADIENT_NODE>; A node drawing a repeating radial gradient
=item C<GSK_CONIC_GRADIENT_NODE>; A node drawing a conic gradient
=item C<GSK_BORDER_NODE>; A node stroking a border around an area
=item C<GSK_TEXTURE_NODE>; A node drawing a B<Gnome::Gdk4::Texture>
=item C<GSK_INSET_SHADOW_NODE>; A node drawing an inset shadow
=item C<GSK_OUTSET_SHADOW_NODE>; A node drawing an outset shadow
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_NODE>; A node that renders its child after applying a matrix transform
=item C<GSK_OPACITY_NODE>; A node that changes the opacity of its child
=item C<GSK_COLOR_MATRIX_NODE>; A node that applies a color matrix to every pixel
=item C<GSK_REPEAT_NODE>; A node that repeats the child's contents
=item C<GSK_CLIP_NODE>; A node that clips its child to a rectangular area
=item C<GSK_ROUNDED_CLIP_NODE>; A node that clips its child to a rounded rectangle
=item C<GSK_SHADOW_NODE>; A node that draws a shadow below its child
=item C<GSK_BLEND_NODE>; A node that blends two children together
=item C<GSK_CROSS_FADE_NODE>; A node that cross-fades between two children
=item C<GSK_TEXT_NODE>; A node containing a glyph string
=item C<GSK_BLUR_NODE>; A node that applies a blur
=item C<GSK_DEBUG_NODE>; Debug information that does not affect the rendering
=item C<GSK_GL_SHADER_NODE>; A node that uses OpenGL fragment shaders to render

=head2 GskScalingFilter

The filters used when scaling texture data.

The actual implementation of each filter is deferred to the
rendering pipeline.
=item C<GSK_SCALING_FILTER_LINEAR>; linear interpolation filter
=item C<GSK_SCALING_FILTER_NEAREST>; nearest neighbor interpolation filter
=item C<GSK_SCALING_FILTER_TRILINEAR>; linear interpolation along each axis,
  plus mipmap generation, with linear interpolation along the mipmap
  levels

=head2 GskSerializationError

Errors that can happen during (de)serialization.
=item C<GSK_SERIALIZATION_UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT>; The format can not be identified
=item C<GSK_SERIALIZATION_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION>; The version of the data is not
  understood
=item C<GSK_SERIALIZATION_INVALID_DATA>; The given data may not exist in
  a proper serialization

=head2 GskTransformCategory

The categories of matrices relevant for GSK and GTK.

Note that any category includes matrices of all later categories.
So if you want to for example check if a matrix is a 2D matrix,
B<category >= GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D> is the way to do this.

Also keep in mind that rounding errors may cause matrices to not
conform to their categories. Otherwise, matrix operations done via
multiplication will not worsen categories. So for the matrix
multiplication B<C = A * B>, B<category(C) = MIN (category(A), category(B))>.
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_UNKNOWN>; The category of the matrix has not been
  determined.
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_ANY>; Analyzing the matrix concluded that it does
  not fit in any other category.
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_3D>; The matrix is a 3D matrix. This means that
  the w column (the last column) has the values (0, 0, 0, 1).
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D>; The matrix is a 2D matrix. This is equivalent
  to graphene_matrix_is_2d() returning C<True>. In particular, this
  means that Cairo can deal with the matrix.
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D_AFFINE>; The matrix is a combination of 2D scale
  and 2D translation operations. In particular, this means that any
  rectangle can be transformed exactly using this matrix.
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_2D_TRANSLATE>; The matrix is a 2D translation.
=item C<GSK_TRANSFORM_CATEGORY_IDENTITY>; The matrix is the identity matrix.
